/**
 * One sensing component of a detector.

 * Factory: {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Factory Factory}<br>
 * Hierarchy: 
 * <code>
 * {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Detector Detector} → 
 * {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Sector Sector} → 
 * {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Superlayer Superlayer} → 
 * {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Layer Layer} → 
 * <b>{@link org.jlab.geom.base.Component Component}</b>
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * {@code Component} contains a {@code Point3D} called {@link #getMidpoint() 
 * midpoint} which generally represents the geometric center of the
 * {@code Component} but may be redefined as needed by specific kinds of
 * {@code Component}s.
 * <p>
 * {@code Component} also contains a {@code double} value called 
 * {@link #getLength() length} that represents the length of the component.
 * What this value measures is dependent on the type of component.
 * <p>
 * {@code Componet}s are also enclosed in volume that are defined points, edges, 
 * and faces.
