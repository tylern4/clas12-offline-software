/**
 * This class provides a basic implementation of the 
 * {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Component} interface where the component's volume
 * is defined by two convex polygons such that the edges of each polygon are
 * connected to form trapezoidal sides. 
 * <p>
 * These volumes are similar to geometric-prisms except that the two polygons do
 * not need to be congruent and do not need to be related by a simple
 * translation. Instead the two base polygons may be incongruent and have
 * arbitrary positions and orientations relative to one another. The only
 * requirement is that the two polygons have the same number of points and must
 * be convex. As a result, the side faces of the volume may be trapezoids rather
 * than parallelograms. Another way to describe these volumes is as generalized
 * polygonal-frustums where the two cutting planes need non be parallel.
 * To my knowledge, there is no simple word for such a shape.
 * <p>
 * In this documentation, the words "polygon", "base", and "face" are used
 * interchangeably.
 * <p>
 * In addition to fulfilling most of the requirements for the {@code Component}
 * interface, {@code PrismaticComponent} provides additional geometry data via
 * {@link #getDirection()} and {@link #getLine()}. The direction is a
 * {@code Vector3D} pointing from the component's
 * {@link #getMidpoint() midpoint} towards the readout end of the component (eg
 * towards the PMT of a scintillator). The line is a {@code Line3D} running down
 * the middle of the length of the component from the geometric center of the
 * first base to the geometric center of the second base.
 * <p>
 * For more information see {@link org.jlab.geom.base.Component}.
 * <p>
 * Developer's Note: This class could be further abstracted such that points
 * in two arbitrary similar-shapes defined by points could be connected to form
 * a volume. This abstracted class could then be subtyped into classes to handle
 * convex polygonal prisms, concave polygonal prisms, and handle cylindrical
 * segment volumes (volumes with two sectors as bases).
